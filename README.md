Murder Rate Prediction in Kerala (2026â€“2030)
This project focuses on predicting the number of murder cases in Kerala for the upcoming 5 years (2026â€“2030) using time-series forecasting techniques.
By leveraging ARIMA modeling, we analyzed past crime data, identified trends, and forecasted future values to provide insights useful for crime prevention strategies.


ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Step 1: Import Libraries

Step 2: Load Dataset

Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Step 5: Model Building (ARIMA)

Step 6: Visualization (Actual vs Forecast)

Step 7: Forecast (2026â€“2030 Murder Predictions)

Step 8: Model Evaluation



ðŸ“Š Key Findings

1. Trend of Murder Cases (2016â€“2024):

Murder cases showed fluctuations across years.

No strong upward or downward long-term trend observed.



2. Stationarity Test:

Data was not stationary (p-value > 0.05).

Differencing was applied to stabilize variance.



3. Future Predictions (2026â€“2030):

Expected range: 335â€“350 murder cases per year.

No sharp spikes or drops anticipated.



4. Practical Implications:

Consistent crime prevention efforts should be maintained.

Community safety programs can be prioritized instead of emergency measures.




âš™ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Statsmodels (ARIMA)



ðŸ“ˆ Results

The ARIMA-based model suggests that Keralaâ€™s murder cases will remain relatively stable over the next five years, highlighting the importance of steady crime prevention measures rather than anticipating drastic fluctuations.
